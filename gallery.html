		<h2>SOME EXAMPLE</h2>
		
		<P>These photos were taken between the years of 2008-2010 and 2013-2015 .</p>
		
		<h3>TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES</h3>
	
		<p>Some tools and techniques that an be used in black and white images include the followings:</p>
		
		<p>shoot in RAW if you camera allowes you, else shoot in color and do your
		conversion to black and white later on your computer</p>
		
		<p>Shoot with the lowest possible ISO possible. While this is something that most of us do in
		color photography it is particularly important when it comes to black and white where
		noise created by ISO can become even more obvious</p>
		
		<p>you need to train yourself to look at shapes, tones and
		textures in your frame as points of interest.Pay particularly
		attention to shadows and highlights which will become a feature of your shot</p>
		
		<p>The complimentary and opposing colours that bring a colour
		image to life are all reduced to black and white or shades of grey
		in a monochrome image and you have to look for tonal contrast to make a shot stand out</p>
